### **Empowering Aadhaar Ecosystem through Microscopic Data Auditing & Anomaly Detection**

This framework is a sophisticated, data-driven audit system designed to identify administrative bottlenecks, reporting latencies, and cross-API inconsistencies within UIDAI datasets. By utilizing Welch's T-Test and Z-Score normalization, our system distinguishes organic transaction demand from systematic administrative pulse patterns.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Data Pipeline
Our architecture is built for high-scale processing and mathematical precision.

![System Architecture](final_submission/images/High-Level%20System%20Architecture.png)

1. **Ingestion Layer:** Automated, memory-efficient chunked loading (100K blocks) via Python Pandas.
2. **Standardization Engine:** Fuzzy Matching (Levenshtein Distance Algorithm) used to resolve district-level naming conflicts between Enrolment and Update APIs.
3. **Statistical Validator:** Anomaly flagging using Z-Score (|Z| > 2.0) and validation of anomalies via Welch's T-test (p < 0.05).
4. **Audit Reporting:** Automated generation of Jury-safe PDF/DOCX reports and interactive data-visuals.

## 📊 High-Impact Findings

### 1. The Naming Paradox (Ghost Districts)
Audit revealed that 6.5% of "Ghost Districts" (High Enrolment / Zero Updates) were artifacts of naming mismatches across backend APIs. 
* **Methodology:** Cross-API Header Auditing.
* **Impact:** Resolved data silos for ~234K transaction records.

### 2. The Monthly Pulse (Batch Processing Delay)
Quantitative proof that 91.3% of transaction data is reported on a 30-day batch cycle.
* **Finding:** Identified a "Batch Pulse" on the 1st of every month, obscuring daily societal trends.
* **Recommendation:** Transition high-growth administrative units to daily ingestion.

### 3. Administrative Process Coupling
Discovered a near-perfect **Pearson Correlation (r = 0.99)** between disparate update streams.
* **Conclusion:** Proves artificial synchronization at the operational level, suggesting load-balancing opportunities.

## 🛠️ Reproduction & Deployment
Professional-grade automation for immediate audit execution.

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Intelligence Audit:**
   ```bash
   python analysis/build_pro_report.py
   ```

3. **Verify Artifacts:**
   Check the `final_submission/` directory for the professional PDF report and the `notebooks/` directory for deep-dive statistical proof.
